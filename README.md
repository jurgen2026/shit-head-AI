The aim of this project is to produce an AI that can play shithead to a competant level and can be plugged into
the react project to play against other humans.

This could even be the first games we ever play as they can just be run locally and don't need a server.

### === TASKS ===

1) Finish the game logic (blinds, face ups, game loop and game over)

2) Look into the best way to run this new version of the game in order to test against AIs. Creating a repl seems to be an early frontrunner so I need to look into that more.

3) Start planning the AI itself (first I build the rules based AI, then the machine learning based AI)
