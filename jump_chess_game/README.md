Hello, welcome to Jumpre's very epic README documentation on his proof-of-concept shitty chess-AI thing.

I have no idea if in the end the AI will be shitty or it might even be pretty good.


## Files
- main.ts: the only actual file here: look at this file
- every other file: I need to tidy up at some point lmao;

## More about the actual project: main.ts

### Function: similarity
- This is the main work of this project so far
- Idea is it returns a float from 0 to 64 that indicates similarity of two given chess board
    - 0 indicates completely not similar
    - 64 indicates very similar
